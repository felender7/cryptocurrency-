          Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that function like traditional money and can serve as means of exchange. They are usually bought through crypto exchange platforms and stored in safe crypto wallets. These digital currencies are decentralized, and they operate in a very secure way with minimal human interactions. As a result, many now classify them as the future of the finance sector.

<h2>Financial Inclusion</h2>
<p>The traditional banking systems use different techniques to market their work. They set aside some projects for select groups of people which cannot be available to the others. These groups get some favors like soft loans, prolonged payment durations, and lower interest rates. As a result, the systems end up being unfair and devoid of financial inclusion.
</p> 

<h2>Security Issues</h2>
<p>
  Skilled technicians can hack many mobile banking apps. As a result, some people end up losing large sums of cash fom their accounts. The systems are also prone to fraud and money embezzlement. These occurrences may result in loss of hard-earned money.

Extra Fees and Slow Transactions
Banks come with extra fees and taxes during transaction periods. For example, the sending and receiving banks usually impose very high transaction fees and taxes during international remittances. Due to slow protocols, these transactions also take a long time, especially for large sums of cash.
